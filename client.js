    // "Explain how the tool React works"

// Assistant
    // "React is a tool built with JavaScript that makes it easy to create user interfaces. 
    // It lets you create a flexible UI that updates automatically as data changes."
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Me
    // "Explain why this is true, preferably with something I can test."

// Assistant
    // "React lets you update the UI automatically when any data changes. You can see this by creating 
    // a few React components and updating their state or passed-in properties. You'll see the UI react to the data changes automatically."
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Me
    // "What is a component in React"

// Assistant
    // "A React component is an isolated section of UI â€“ for example, a button, or a list of items. 
    // It's implemented as a JavaScript class, and rendered into HTML. This makes it easy to reuse 
    // components in different places and update them independently."
